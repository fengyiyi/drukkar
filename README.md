Drukkar
=======

Drukkar is a small blogging platform made with the following in mind:

*   low bandwidth use (enabling access over slow GSM connections and Tor)
*   working without a database (Drukkar can be installed in `public_html` on that university server account your have)
*   ease of releasing files with your posts (say, for a game dev blog)

Pick up the documentation and see it in action at <http://drukkar.sourceforge.net/>.

The project is hosted at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/drukkar/> ([code](https://sourceforge.net/p/drukkar/code/)) and <https://github.com/dbohdan/drukkar>.
