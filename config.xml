    <entries_dir>entries/</entries_dir><!-- Where the entries are kept relative to base_location. -->
    <files_dir>files/</files_dir><!-- Where the uploaded files are kept relative to base_location. -->

    <title>Blog title here</title><!-- Blog's title. Always visible at the top. -->
    <subtitle></subtitle><!-- Displayed right under the title. -->
    <password>696d29e0940a4957748fe3fc9efd22a3</password><!-- The salted hash of your password goes here. Use makepass.php to calculate it. The default is "password". -->

    <entry_date_from_file_name>0</entry_date_from_file_name><!-- If you set this to 1 instead of using the date field in each entry Drukkar will try to parse the entry's file name as a date. Useful in some semi-exotic cases. -->
